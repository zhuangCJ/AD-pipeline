# AD-pipeline
This is a pipeline of AD identification, segmentation and Stanford subtyping.
Run the AD_pipeline.py file for automatic identification, segmentation, and Stanford classification of aortic dissection. Add your CTA data path in the AD_pipeline.py file, make sure the CTA data is stored in .nii.gz format, make sure the CTA data includes the aorta region. Ensure that the CTA data size is 512*512*n to achieve optimal classification and segmentation performance.
Please go to the following link (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M_iO6JBVx93YySgk9_f2DziHTRX09IIm/view?usp=drive_link) to download the aorta segmentation network and true lumen and false lumen segmentation network model parameters, and store the folder in the same directory as the AD_pipeline.py file.
